# Documentation on Vicsek models

- Research on the model seems to be concentrated on a small number of groups
- There are two different types. **Experimental** of **theoretical**

<u>Research groups identified:</u>
- Cavagna and Giardina (experimental and new modeling to interpret data)
- Baglietto (theoretician, looks at behaviour of the model specifically)
- Vicsek (does he still do research on this topic ?)
-
